# RiceTest1ReviewSolutions
Solutions to the test 1 review.

These are the solutions to the test 1 review problems posted on Schoology. Note that these solutions do not represent the only way to do these problems, nor do they necessarily use the most efficient methods since we have only learned a few things in class so far. The solution to problem 4 needs to be done in Python 3 otherwise it won't work due to how Python 2 deals with complex numbers.
